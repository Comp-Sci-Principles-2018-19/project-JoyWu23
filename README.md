# Project Name:
Plants vs. CO2

## Problem
There is a rapid increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to human activity, causing climate change and global warming. Extreme weathers bring about nature disasters including hurricanes, superstorms, wildfire, and flooding. If this continues, millions of lives will be threatened.

## Big Fat Idea
Plant enough trees to offset the rise in carbon dioxide since trees fixate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into harmless organic matters. Start an organization that gets people to plant trees, educate them on how to do so, and provides seedlings for them to do so.

## First Agile Iteration
Write a program to calculate the amount of trees needed and the time needed in order to stop the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The user inputs an amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the program returns the number of trees needed. For this, I'm going to do some preliminary research on the constant of how much carbon dioxide the average tree reduces.
