# Project Name:
Plants vs. CO2

## Problem
There is a rapid increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to human activity, causing climate change and global warming. Extreme weathers bring about nature disasters including hurricanes, superstorms, wildfire, and flooding. If this continues, millions of lives will be threatened.

## Big Fat Idea
Plant enough trees to offset the rise in carbon dioxide. Trees fixate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into harmless organic matters.

## First Agile Iteration
Write a program to calculate the amount of trees needed in order to stop the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
